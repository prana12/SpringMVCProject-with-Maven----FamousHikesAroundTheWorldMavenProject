The route is a scenic one through dense bamboo and rose tree forests that will take you passed waterfalls and snow-capped mountain peaks. The trek is known for having one of the best views of the Annapurna Range.

The bonus that comes along with the wild scenery is the chance to get to know the unique culture of the local people.
